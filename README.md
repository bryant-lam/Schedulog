## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin**: Kotlin is the programming language used alongside Android Studio to develop and test the application.

- **Firebase**: Firebase is the datastore used to store information on events, schedules, ratings, account information, and more.

- **Figma**: Figma is used to design the UI, plan the navigation, and prototype the UX for Schedulog.

## Features

- **Schedule Managing**: Users are able to add/attend, delete, and edit events 

- **Schedule Comparing**: Compare schedules with other users to find conflicts and resolve them in a timely manner.

- **Event Ratings**: Rate events to help build credibility for the host.

- **Event Searching/Filtering**: Quickly find and filter events to match your interest and schedule.

- **Alerts**: Receive alerts a day in advance to remind you of an upcoming event.

## Learning Experience

- **Agile**: The agile methodology is used to minimize risk early on and add flexibility to changes within our features.

- **Team Collaboration**: I learned collaborative problem-solving skills and strengthened my communication skills.

- **Version Control**: I had experience solving merge conflicts and performed code integration consistently. Feature branching enabled isolated development and smoother integration of new features.

- **Relational Database**: I structured the database for our application, implementing practices to reduce data redundancy and improve data fetching.
